## [SE Interests and Experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-klueter-26378b1a0/)
I love art and visuals so I am really interested in front end development and I am hoping to get more experience with that through projects. Currently, I am working on a project in React Native.

Here's a funny quote I found about CS and JavaScript that many make misconceptions about:
> Java is to JavaScript what car is to carpet

Sometimes in school (especially during the pandemic) I relate to this:
```
while(alive) {
    eat();
    sleep();
    code();
    repeat();
}
```
Technically the code already repeats with the loop, but you get the idea.
